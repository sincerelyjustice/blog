{"blogs":[{"title":"Terrible Deaths","path":"terrible-deaths","tags":["psychology"],"content":"Here are some of the worst ways to die:\n\n1. Drowning/suffocating\n2. Burning alive\n3. A harsh disease especially which affects your brain, e.g. rabies\n4. Being eaten alive, e.g. by a bear\n5. An ingenious human method, e.g. scaphism, crucifixion\n\nIf you're alone, and if your death comes without any sense or purpose, these are all generally much worse. If you're alienated from God or you have no religious conception of death, these are also all generally worse. Sometimes if your death does come with sense or purpose but the thing was *your fault*, they're worse -- because you could've avoided it and now you've squandered the rest of your life. And if you feel like you still have a lot to give and a lot of potential then these are also all generally worse. Sometimes it's better if (you think) the thing was your fault, because you feel like you deserve your punishement. If you've sinned really badly and you think that this is your just desert, you may be able to submit more to the experience. That's related to the fact that some of these are especially bad if you're trying to escape, or if you're given false hope, e.g. 1. is especially bad if you're struggling and panicking. That can happen before or during the event. If before, it can worsen the effect of anticpation/dread as each of your ideas about how you're going to get out of this prove frightfully insufficient.\n\nConsider that people change their lives so that they can be more ready to face incidents like this -- and it's no  wonder. Most of all ofc, we should be preparing to stop them from happening. E.g. 3. makes me want to study biology and to become a doctor. But the threat will always be there. So in the seat of comfort and luxury, do not be so quick to pass judgement especially upon people's 'irrational' beliefs and practices, which help them to cope with this awful state of affairs. Do not think you're so smart that you can see through to the origin of a behaviour and scoff. You have not yet been tested. \n\n","timestamp":1698526680544},{"title":"Code Masters","path":"code-masters","tags":["code"],"content":"We should have master-apprentice programmes for software engineers. *Master-apprentice programmes* are part-structured part-unstructured programmes of one-on-one guidance, discussion, and debate between a 'master' and an 'apprentice' developer. It's like pair programming, but where a lot more explicit focus is given to principles/ideas/meta-issues, rather than to the particularities of any specific task.[^1] \n\n[^1]: I think there's still a lot of low-hanging fruit re coding principles and I recently started a series about those we currently live by unspoken (see [Visual Coding Principles](/blog/visual-coding-principles)). I believe that focus on these principles is high impact, and also in general associatedly that there is also overvalued among developers incidental knowledge about particular technologies. \n\nWhat would such a programme accomplish? Mainly, it would accomplish the creation of more code masters. A code master is a maturation of the idea of a 10x developer. Code masters produce a much greater output than ordinary developers, and also, they do so at a greater quality. That means that they count for many such developers, and in some ways for more than any number of them. A code master is an artist whose abilites inspire awe among the non-masters.\n\nWhy do master-apprentice programmes work? Several reasons:[^2]\n\n[^2]: Some stipulations are implicit herein in the matter of the master choosing their apprentice wisely and vice versa.\n\n- The ability for the master to study the apprentice and to recognise patterns in their mistakes. This enables the master to share especially high-leverage, tailored insights. \n- The ability for an apprentice to be insistently curious, to keep asking why questions, and for the master to follow their individual train of thought. \n- The formation of bonds of trust. The apprentice and master can grow to trust one another, and therefore feel safe to share radical or otherwise-fraught ideas. \n- The intimacy of comparison between the apprentice and the master. The comparison between apprentice and master can foster a competitve, aspirational instinct in the apprentice (which can be extremely powerful); and in the master, it can foster his desire to prove himself a master, and thus to make his premises more robust (which can also be extremely powerful). \n\nNote that my sense is that code masters in our world are very rare. Part of that is because they don't take on apprentices. If as a rule a master takes on two apprentices, and raises them to mastery, let's say over the course of a few years, then we would soon have a lot more masters in the world. However, since masters are so rare, we should begin our master-apprentice programmes more imperfectly -- between what we more comfortably refer to as simply 'senior' and 'junior' developers. The environment of much idea-sharing should occasionally mean that therby are produced true code masters. Those masters can then gradually be introduced as the more predominant leaders of the programmes. And once there are a lot of masters, perhaps we can also be less shy about identifying them. \n\n\n\n","timestamp":1698672032969},{"title":"Code Directors","path":"code-directors","tags":["code"],"content":"A code director is akin to a movie director. He oversees a codebase, and he calls the shots. Here's a summary of his role.\n\n- He 'owns' the codebase. It's 'his'.\n- He answers to the overall quality of the codebase. If something's gone rotten, he is responsible.\n- He reviews all inputs. E.g. he reviews every ticket.\n- He reviews all outputs. E.g. he reviews every pull request.\n- He inputs. Given an understanding of the needs of the codebase, the business trusts him to create and to allocate work.\n- He outputs. He contributes to the codebase.\n\n### Why Code Directors?\n\nWhat's that all for? Why would we want a code director? \n\nI'll build up to it.\n\n#### Background\n\nWithin a team, collective decision-making is hard. A collective lacks conviction. Often, decisions don't get made, and even discussions about an issue are avoided. If decisions do get made, often an irrational process had to intervene such as voting. So the team fails to make much progress. In order to make progress, the team recognises that it must develop some means of individualising decision-making in the majority of cases.\n\nThe prevalent means by which this is done in a software development context is by dividing up responsibilities amongst the team and by giving team members decision-making power over their own individual components e.g. over their own tickets. They form a so-called 'agile team'.\n\n#### Problems\n\nI suggest that there are some problems with the existing model of an agile team. And that at the prompting of which we should upgrade the agile team to a *directed agile team*, by adding a code director role. \n\nConsider a couple of facts:\n\n1. By giving everyone decision-making power, everyone, somewhere, makes their own decisions about the code, and their own standards apply.[^1]\n\n2. By dividing out responsibilities, no one is responsible for the codebase entire.\n\n[^1]: There are a vast many subtleties about the way people code which are impossible to normalise automatically and may yet lack any kind of recognition in language.\n\nWhence we have the following problems:\n\n1. From Fact (1), since decisions, as a matter of their composing principles, will vary between developers, this will lead to a measure of incoherence, inconsistency and general confusion across the codebase.\n\n2. From Fact (2), developers who are not responsible for the entire codebase will often focus on climbing their own local optimum at the expense of the global one. I.e., they will be biased in favour of one metric, which is relevant to their work, over some ignored other.\n\n3. From Fact (1) and Fact (2): If a lower-skill developer has decision-making power, and no other developer has the ownership sufficient to bother overruling their work, lower-standard decisions can enter into canon.\n\nNow, having a code director partially undermines Fact (1), and undermines Fact (2) by definition, so let's think about the positive impact of introducing a code director re solving these problems.\n\nFor Problem (1), we get a partial solution in that everything must pass through the code directors mind: there is a single party, the director, that is always present at least to review every piece of work. We have a consistent normalising factor which is the scrutiny of whatever the director's standards are. His ways of working are the effective default. We're still assuming that the brainpower of a group effort is necessary, so since the director is plausibly not completely reinventing each developer's work upon submission, some inconsistent standards will still slip through. But this provides us with a new defence.\n\nFor Problem (2), we theoretically get a complete solution, assuming that the code director does his job. There is pressure on him to consider the state of the codebase as a whole. So it will not do for him to be disrespecting metrics that happen to be out-of-focus for some specific piece of work.\n\nFor Problem (3), we get somewhat of a soution in that the code director has to answer for any bad code that gets through him. He has an incentive to do throughgoing quality control. And also since the code director should generally be the best developer in a team, there should be applied thereby the best quality control that the team could muster.\n\nSo having a code director would help solve some important problems with existing agile teams. \n\n#### More accounting\n\nTo solve problems (1)-(3), I used the fact that the code director owns and is responsible for the codebase, and the fact that he reviews all outputs. But what of the other named aspects of his role? \n\nAll should considered complementary to this core idea of 'ownership'. Let's briefly expand upon each. \n\n- *He reviews all inputs. E.g. he reviews every ticket.*\n\nThe code director is basically the Product Owner's go-to man. Why? Because he understands the codebase the best; he's best able to represent the interests of developers; and he understands what's possible and practical for the team. \n\n- *He inputs. Given an understanding of the needs of the codebase, the business trusts him to create and to allocate work.*\n\nAgain this is an expectation following that the code director understands the codebase the best. E.g. he will know when it's appropriate to clear certain technical debt. \n\n- *He outputs. He contributes to the codebase.*\n\nWhen the code director does things himself, he finds out a lot through trial and error about what works for the code and what doesn't, and that can save him from \"Can't we just ...\"s when evaluating other people's work. Also, evidence of the code director's skillful contributions can help teammates view him as more of a leader since he \"models advancement of the cause\" (see my [blog](/blog/leadership) on leadership). They at least can respect him more and might be less bristly about his offering opinions. \n\n### Successful Code Directors\n\nI'll list a few things generically required for a code director to be successful:\n\n- A code director should a code master (see my [blog](/blog/code-masters) re code masters). That means he should be a very knowledgable and competent developer. If he's not, he can become a big bottleneck for (good) work getting through to production. \n\n- A code director should be a good communicator. This is so his teammates want to work with him, can come to believe in his principles, and so that the work they do is done with care in consequence.\n\n- A code director should not be easily cowed. He should be intolerant of *bad product*. He should always enforce his high standards, not allowing himself to get pressured into something inadequate.\n\n- A code director should be prepared for long-term commitment to a codebase! \n\n### A Transitonal Mode\n\nI'm going to wrap things up now. Here's a closing thought. For modern software development, on large-scale projects, a directed agile team is in my mind the proper next increment moving on from an agile team. But that isn't my final vision for the future. I think of the code director as a prelude to the developer who leads even large-scale projects completely on his lonesome! -- a single code master with formiddable mind, who uses some AI buddy to account for incidental knowledge. Developer and AI like Jedi and droid. This one-developer approach is part of my other vision of raising more code masters through master-apprentice programmes (again see my recent [blog](/blog/code-masters) about this).\n","timestamp":1698779140042},{"title":"Visual Coding Principles","path":"visual-coding-principles","tags":["code"],"content":"This blog is the first of (possibly) a series about coding principles which _I don't see taught_, but which are _necessary to understand if you want to be a Jedi master_. \n\nI claim that mastery often involves being able to wring principles from that which others are content to leave unspoken -- as matters of intuition, or as matters of taste. So I want to use this series to try to push out the boundary of the logos, to further articulate and control. When something doesn't feel quite right -- when perhaps you shift things about and all clicks into place -- we must consider, explicitly: _What was that?_ What difference made the difference? What was God's design?\n\nAllow me before we start to pay the toll to modesty: I am not a Jedi master. I have worked as a web developer with merely intermediate skill, and there're a lot of things I don't know. Nevertheless, it is a deep compulsion within my person that draws me to these topics, and ergo I have developed my piece, which I'm sharing with you today. \n\nToday we focus on unspoken coding principles, and specifically those principles *visual*.\n\n### The Task\n\nLet's say that we're given the following task.\n\n1. Write a Javascript function `getClockTime` which returns the hours and minutes that would appear on a digital clock, which are associated with a specific `Date` instance, formatted as a string.\n2. For several different implementations of such a function, evaluate their visual-based merits and demerits, and deduce any attendant principles.\n\nTo clarify number 1., our goal is basically to re-implement:\n\n```javascript\ndate.toLocaleTimeString('en-GB', {\n  hour: '2-digit',\n  minute: '2-digit',\n});\n```\n\nwhere e.g.:\n\n```javascript\nconst date = new Date('1995-12-25T23:15:30'); // then\ngetClockTime(date); // returns 23:15\n```\n\nHopefully you get the idea. I know it's a bit of a strange example, but it's true to a project that I was working on where I didn't know that the `toLocaleTimeString` method existed, and where I recognised that I was thinking about the things which make the subject of this blog. So we're gonna go with it.\n\n### Implementation 1\n\nFirst for `getClockTime`, I offer Implementation 1:\n\n```javascript\nconst getClockTime = (date) => {\n  let hours = date.getHours();\n  let minutes = date.getMinutes();\n  if (hours < 10) {\n    hours = `0${hours}`;\n  }\n  if (minutes < 10) {\n    minutes = `0${minutes}`;\n  }\n  return `${hours}:${minutes}`;\n};\n```\n\nNote that all of our implementations will work in essentially this same way: we get the hours and miutes from methods on the date object; consider whether we need to prepend 0s; and then join them up with a colon. The different implementations will be interesting to us principally because they look different.\n\nHow does this first implementation look? I claim: _wrong_. I note a couple of problems, and the first is that we have violated a principle, which I call _The Principle of Line Waves_.\n\n### The Principle of Line Waves\n\nNotice the positions, which I've marked, of the ends of the lines of this function:\n\n```javascript\nconst getClockTime = (date) => {\n  let hours = date.getHours(); /\n  let minutes = date.getMinutes(); /\n  if (hours < 10) { /\n    hours = `0${hours}`; /\n  } /\n  if (minutes < 10) { /\n    minutes = `0${minutes}`; /\n  } /\n  return `${hours}:${minutes}`; /\n};\n```\n\nAt a glance, you plausibly perceive as a developer that there is made out a pattern such as:\n\nThe 'Two Bumps' pattern:\n\n```javascript\nconst getClockTime = (date) => {\n  let hours = date.getHours();    \\\n  let minutes = date.getMinutes();  |\n  if (hours < 10) {               /\n    hours = `0${hours}`;       /\n  }                          |\n  if (minutes < 10) {         \\\n    minutes = `0${minutes}`;    \\\n  }                               |\n  return `${hours}:${minutes}`;  /\n};\n```\n\nOr the 'Comeback' Pattern:\n\n```javascript\nconst getClockTime = (date) => {\n  let hours = date.getHours();        /\n  let minutes = date.getMinutes();  /\n  if (hours < 10) {               /\n    hours = `0${hours}`;        /\n  }                           /\n  if (minutes < 10) {         \\\n    minutes = `0${minutes}`;    \\\n  }                               \\\n  return `${hours}:${minutes}`;     \\\n};\n```\n\nMyself, I see 'Two Bumps'.\n\nSo what's my point? I claim that both of these patterns are significant. Both of the patterns _affect_ you. (Especially if your someone for whom the function is basic enough that you have the mental space to allow the patterns to affect you; and especially if right now you're not focused on disagreeing with me.) Likely too, by the way, the affect is subconcious.\n\nWhat is the meaning of that affect? It's _something_ -- the patterns have connotations. For instance, 'Two Bumps' suggests to me that there are somehow two pushes of work in the function. There are two teams, somehow reasonably, logically grouped together, which accomplish their own piece of work. And also the continuity of the bumps suggests that the teams somehow imply one another or are complementary. This is often well-fitted to if-else statments like this example from the code for (the script for removing blogs from) this blog:\n\n```javascript\nif (!blogs.some(matchesTitle)) {                  \\\n  console.log(`\\nBlog '${title}' was not found.`); |\n  process.exit(1);                                /\n} else {                                         \\\n  writeBlogs(blogs.filter(negator(matchesTitle))); |\n  cleanupImages(title);                            /\n  console.log(`\\nBlog '${title}' removed.`);     /\n}                                              /\n;\n```\n\nThe 'Comeback' pattern on the other hand suggests to me that the function's code is somehow strong, and then settles down a bit, and then gets strong again -- like that there is something interesting/significant/involved/difficult/unique followed by less so followed by more so again. Here is an example from a separate project:\n\n```javascript\nconst setupFormSubmission = (inputNames, endpoint) => {\n  const form = getForm();\n  const handleSubmit = async (submitEvent) => {   /\n    submitEvent.preventDefault();                /\n    const formData = inputNames.reduce(         /\n      (formData, inputName) => ({              /\n        ...formData,                          /\n        [inputName]: form[inputName].value,  /\n      }),                                   /\n      {}                                   /\n    );                                     |\n    await postData(formData, endpoint);      \\\n  };                                            \\\n  form.addEventListener(\"submit\", handleSubmit);  \\\n};\n```\n\n(I have strained the applicability of the pattern slightly here for the sake of not having to make up an example.) In this case it makes sense that the-idea-that-we-are-defining-a-form-submission-handler, as well as the-attachment-of-that-handler-to-the-form would be the 'loudest' points of `setupFormSubmission`.\n\nSo what's happened here is that I have taken the patterns made out by our function's line lengths and I have inferred something about the function's operation -- that it has two pushes of work, has loud-quiet-loud logic, etc.\n\nNow I elevate this idea to a general principle. In general, the patterns formed about the ends of the lines of a function, which I call the _line waves_, (may) have connotations which impact your perception of the operation of the function. Also, that impact can be more or less accurate to the real operation of the function. When it _is_ accurate to the real operation of the function, I say that the function is _linusoidal_; and else, it's not. _The Principle of Line Waves_ is that functions should be linusoidal. By the way, you can replace function with module or class throughout.\n\nImplementation 1 is not linusoidal. I have suggested that there is a meaningful impact of its line waves. And it is an easy exercise to explain that that impact is misleading. E.g. For 'Two Bumps', I expect minimally to see correspondent two logical groupings of work. Here is one such:\n\n```javascript\nlet hours = date.getHours();    \\\nlet minutes = date.getMinutes(); |\nif (hours < 10) {              /\n  hours = `0${hours}`;      /\n}                       /\n```\n\nWhich is no such. \n\nHow do we make the function linusoidal? One simple technique is to 'break the wave' by adding newlines as below:\n\n```javascript\nconst getClockTime = (date) => {\n  let hours = date.getHours();     \\\n  let minutes = date.getMinutes();  \\\n\n  if (hours < 10) {       \\\n    hours = `0${hours}`;   \\\n  }                         \\\n  if (minutes < 10) {        \\\n    minutes = `0${minutes}`;  \\\n  }\n\n  return `${hours}:${minutes}`; \\\n};\n```\n\nNotice then how that instead of 'Two Bumps', or the 'Comeback', we have mainly just those two distinct slopes which suggest _bit of logic followed by separate bit of logic_, which at least is accurate and I think this makes the function look a lot better. Really. \n\nSo that is the principle of line waves and our simple way here of addressing it. But then of course that leaves still the matter of the second problem, evident with or without newlines -- since recall that I noted that there were a couple of problems with Implementation 1 -- and the second is that we have violated another principle, this time which I call _The Principle of Visual Balance_.\n\n### The Principle of Visual Balance\n\nNotice the chunkiness of this middle section for the if statements:\n\n```javascript\nif (hours < 10) {\n  hours = `0${hours}`;\n}\nif (minutes < 10) {\n  minutes = `0${minutes}`;\n}\n```\n\nIt takes up six lines. For this function, that is a fair deal of space. And thereby, it puts significant weight — I argue, too much weight — on the matter of prefixing the zeros.\n\nConsider `getClockTime`’s perspective. From its perspective, a lot of the 'important work' should’ve already been done once we had gotten the actual relevant number of hours and minutes, from the date object, for the time. To dedicate a bunch of its lines to this minor other thing, re prefixing the zeros -- it's a distortion. When I look at this function and I gauge its key operations, its key work, my attention is drawn to this overlarge middle portion. And that misrepresents the abstract story about `getClockTime`'s responsibilities.\n\nTo come at this with the help of an alternative context, one place for which similar considerations frequently arise is in the rendering logic in the return statement of a React component. \n\nFor the page that you're currently reading this on, which is written using React, the distinguishing logic resides in a component called `BlogPage`. When I was adding the ability for me to edit blogs, I added the ability also for the user to see a 'last edited' date. That made the return statement of `BlogPage` look like this:\n\n```javascript\nreturn blog ? (\n  <div className={styles.blogContainer}>\n    <article className={styles.blog}>\n      <h1 className={styles.blogTitle}>{blog.title}</h1>\n      <span className={styles.blogDate}>\n        <small>{getCalendarDate(blog.timestamp)}</small>\n        {blog.lastEdited && (\n          <small>\n            (<em>Last edited:</em> {getCalendarDate(blog.lastEdited)})\n          </small>\n        )}\n      </span>\n      <hr />\n      <main>\n        <Markdown>{blog.content}</Markdown>\n      </main>\n    </article>\n  </div>\n) : null;\n```\n\nWith that option of an additional 'last edited' date, suddenly a bunch of space in the return statment is afforded to the logic of date-gathering. At a glance, one can barely even notice the `h1` for the blog's title. And thus introduces a problem of a misdistribution of emphasis.\n\nI fixed this problem by introducing a separate component, `BlogDate`, to encapsulate the date-gathering logic, changing the return statment like so:\n\n```javascript\nreturn blog ? (\n  <div className={styles.blogContainer}>\n    <article className={styles.blog}>\n      <h1 className={styles.blogTitle}>{blog.title}</h1>\n      <BlogDate blog={blog} />\n      <hr />\n      <main>\n        <Markdown>{blog.content}</Markdown>\n      </main>\n    </article>\n  </div>\n) : null;\n```\n\nWhich is obviously much neater and reads much more sensibly. \n\nIn both of the examined cases then, what is the underlying, regulating principle? We should be able to generalise. \n\nWell, in general, the proportion of space that a piece of code occupies in its containing function (which combines line length, line number, and negative space) affects your perception of the code’s importance to that function -- of the importance of understanding that code in order that you might understand the function, and the function's responsibilities. I say that when this effect of *perceived* importance is accurate to the *true* importance, then the function is _visually balanced_; and else it’s not. _The Principle of Visual Balance_ is that functions should be visually balanced. (Again you can replace module or class.)\n\nReturning to our case of Implementation 1, I am claiming that we have violated this principle. To respect it, one thing that we can do, which is possible in Javascript, is to get rid of those braces for the if statements, reducing a hefty six lines into a more modest two:\n\n```javascript\nconst getClockTime = (date) => {\n  let hours = date.getHours();\n  let minutes = date.getMinutes();\n\n  if (hours < 10) hours = `0${hours}`;\n  if (minutes < 10) minutes = `0${minutes}`;\n\n  return `${hours}:${minutes}`;\n};\n```\n\nAnd since the context has changed for the line waves, I would bring this together like so to obtain:\n\n```javascript\nconst getClockTime = (date) => {\n  let hours = date.getHours();\n  let minutes = date.getMinutes();\n  if (hours < 10) hours = `0${hours}`;\n  if (minutes < 10) minutes = `0${minutes}`;\n  return `${hours}:${minutes}`;\n};\n```\n\nAnd, ah, that's better. Notice that the matter of prefixing the zeros is much more snappy -- `getClockTime` is more appropriately impatient with it. And we achieve (at least a greater) visual balance.\n\nAlso, note with this development that the ends of the lines of the function now form a new pattern, which is worth evaluating, and which also I supsect is quite common, and which I call the 'Reset' pattern:\n\n```javascript\nconst getClockTime = (date) => {\n  let hours = date.getHours();        \\\n  let minutes = date.getMinutes();       \\\n  if (hours < 10) hours = `0${hours}`;      \\\n  if (minutes < 10) minutes = `0${minutes}`;  |\n  return `${hours}:${minutes}`;              /\n};\n```\n\nThe 'Reset' pattern happens whenever you have a slope in a function's body followed by a shorter return statement. What this suggests is like that there was a chunk of work building up to the return statement, and which statement, short and blunt, was then able to draw everything together and to tie it off succintly with a bow. Moreover then this suggests to me that the function should not have any side effects, or any leakages or suchlike, because it's as if everything was cleaned up at the return. \n\nSince those suggested meanings are accurate to the context of `getClockTime`, the function remains linusoidal. And with visual balance, the two previously-noted problems are thus no more for Implemenation 1. So is that all?\n\n### Pivoting into Implementation 2\n\nInstead of simply presenting Implementation 2, I will motivate it. For the sake at least of curiosity, here are some problems that yet remain with Implementation 1, which do not have a visual basis, but which in the course of an ordinary developer's thought process may suggest that there is a better path:\n\n1. You should try to avoid reassigning variables where the reassignment so causes the meaning of the variable to become ambiguous. In our case, the hours/minutes variable holds an integer, and subsequently, confusingly, is reassigned to a string.\n2. These two lines:\n\n  ```javascript\n  if (hours < 10) hours = `0${hours}`;\n  if (minutes < 10) minutes = `0${minutes}`;\n  ```\n\n  have the same logic, and it would be nice to know -- like, OK, but to what abstraction does that logic correspond? Because that is the abstraction that `getClockTime` would preferably deal with. Contrast with the first two lines:\n\n  ```javascript\n  let hours = date.getHours();\n  let minutes = date.getMinutes();\n  ```\n\n  Here there is encapsulated some relevant logic, and `getClockTime` is just exposed this interface of `getHours` or `getMinutes`. `getClockTime` is responsible for a certain 'level of the converation', and the first two lines just set the tone. We want more appropriately to conform to it in the subsequent lines. \n  \n3. Sometimes there is a linting rule in the codebase you're working in about if statements always having braces. In that case the implementation that we have without them would not be possible. It might seem a bit anti-climactic for me to point this out but I thought that it was worth doing so for the sake of the general point that occassionally one has to deal with annoying incidental facts like this.\n\nSo with a mind to solving all three of those problems, let us introduce Implementation 2.\n\n### Implementation 2\n\n```javascript\nconst getClockTime = (date) => {\n  const hours = date.getHours();\n  const minutes = date.getMinutes();\n  const clockHours = getClockDigits(hours);\n  const clockMinutes = getClockDigits(minutes);\n  return `${clockHours}:${clockMinutes}`;\n};\n\nconst getClockDigits = (time) => {\n  return `${erasable('0', time >= 10)}${time}`;\n};\n```\n\nWhat's changed here? Importantly, Implementation 2 makes use of a new function, `getClockDigits`, which does the work of the earlier if statements. I've also been a bit cheeky and I've introduced a third function, which I’m assuming that you have access to by another means, which `getClockDigits` uses, called `erasable`. Now the reason that I thought it was excusable for me to include this was because I thought it might be a good, instructive aside for me to outline the reason why I'd want to. \n\nNote that `erasable` works like this: \n\n```javascript\nconst erasable = (string, erasureCondition) => {\n  return erasureCondition ? '' : string;\n}\n```\n\nThe reason that I'd want to include it is because I think that it’s good to have little functions like this that give-you-a-name-for-the-thing and which declare your intentions. For `erasable` in particular, I also like the way that it puts emphasis on possible erasure of a substantial string, instead of say addition of an empty string. I also like the way that it gives you a visual metaphor. \n\nAnyway, we’re not super concerned about how `getClockDigits` works because we’re focused on `getClockTime`. We might be more concerned about it if we were considering visual principles at the module level. So let's consider `getClockTime`.\n\n#### Line waves and visual balance \n\nWe've identified a couple of principles already. So how does Implementation 2 square up?\n\nFor line waves, we have a slightly less pronounced 'Reset' pattern.\n\n```javascript\nconst getClockTime = (date) => {\n  const hours = date.getHours();           \\\n  const minutes = date.getMinutes();         \\\n  const clockHours = getClockDigits(hours);    \\\n  const clockMinutes = getClockDigits(minutes);  \\\n  return `${clockHours}:${clockMinutes}`;       /\n};\n```\n\nWhich is still adequate. And so the function is still linusoidal. \n\nFor visual balance, we have a similar core distribution of space. And so the function is still visually balanced. \n\n(Actually, I'd argue all the more so. Notice that, despite the fact that `getClockDigits` only, as a matter of fact, involves possibly prefixing zeros, the higher stature of the abstraction in `getClockTime` means that lines 3 and 4 have done more to earn their place.)\n\n### The Mosaic Principle\n\nNow we're going to use Implementation 2 to identify a third principle -- not from the principle's violation, but from the appearance of having conformed to it. Implementation 2 conforms to a third principle, which I call *The Mosaic Principle*. \n \nNote: This principle will be somewhat annoying to demonstrate. I have accepted certain formatting limitations for this blog, and there are issues with me choosing now to include images, and so for the matters discussed the reader will either have to use their imagination or to paste the relevant code into some editor they have on hand.\n\nHere's the background. \n\nNotice that Implementation 2 involves a predominace of variable declarations on the left hand side. On the right hand side, a predominance of function calls. Your editor will colour each of these in a consistent fashion. In my editor, the left hand side is predominantly blue, and the right a light yellowish/beige-ish colour. It looks consistent and orderly, which feels soothing and safe. Compare that to Implementation 1. The admixture of variable declarations and function calls with in this case if conditions, numeric literals, and a sprinkling more of template strings, makes for a greater disorder of colours and makes one thereby more uneasy. \n\nIt's so that Implementation 1 lies especially in accordance with a principle which I call *The Mosaic Principle*. The idea is that the colours that your editor uses to highlight your code within a function form a more or less visually pleasing mosaic. I say that when the colours _are_ visually pleasing, then the function is *mosaical*; else, it’s not. *The Mosaic Principle* is that functions should mosaical (relative to some benchmark of syntax highlighting). \n\nNow, you will notice that I am introducing this principle with a little less motivation than the others. I will say briefly that I consider it to be the lowest priority of those mentioned. Obviously one thing to note is that, since it’s probably not a good idea to standardise syntax highlighting across say your team, there is going to be some variation in the relevant colours painting a function's code between developers, and so the principle bears only or mainly upon projects undertaken by a single individual. Another thing to note is that I’ve stated the principle in terms of what’s \"visually pleasing\", but it’s unclear to me what the role of that feeling of visual pleasure is. What information am I getting from the function's mosaic? Is that useful? Misleading? Is a good mosaic proxying for something else which should more justly be the focus? I'm not entirely sure. \n\n### Pivoting into Implementation 3\n\nRegardless, we can now name three principles: of line waves, visual balance, and the mosaic principle. Now we will move on to a third implementation of `getClockTime`, which will allow us to study the principles further, and to see what else becomes of a fresh face. What cause is there to move on this time? \n\nOne thing which you might be alert to in Implementation 2 (here it is again for a reminder)\n\n```javascript \nconst getClockTime = (date) => {\n  const hours = date.getHours();           \n  const minutes = date.getMinutes();         \n  const clockHours = getClockDigits(hours);    \n  const clockMinutes = getClockDigits(minutes);  \n  return `${clockHours}:${clockMinutes}`;       \n};\n```\n\nis this repetition of \"hours\", \"minutes\", \"clockHours\", \"clockMinutes\", and especially if we were going to add seconds to that list, you might wonder simply why we were choring ourselves with so much work. And thus here is a means to get rid of it:\n\n### Implemetation 3\n\n```javascript\nconst getClockTime = (date) => {\n  const time = [date.getHours(), date.getMinutes()];\n  const clock = time.map(getClockDigits); \n  return clock.join(':');\n};\n\nconst getClockDigits = (unit) => {\n  return `${erasable('0', unit >= 10)}${unit}`;\n};\n```\n\nSo, again, we have something which works in essentially the same way, the treatment on this occasion using an array. And what of the principles?\n\n#### Line waves and visual balance and mosaicality\n\nNotice that Implementation 3 is nicely linusoidal:\n\n```javascript\nconst getClockTime = (date) => {\n  const time = [date.getHours(), date.getMinutes()]; /\n  const clock = time.map(getClockDigits);         /\n  return clock.join(':');                     /\n};\n```\n\nIt follows a 'Convergent' or 'Funnel' pattern; which in general suggests getting closer and closer to the return statement with each line building upon the previous; it suggests progressively 'separating the wheat from the chaff'; and we don’t take any sort of tangents or detours. Since that attests truly to our implementation (we get the time, and from the time we get the clock, and from the clock we get the clockTime), we have the principle of line waves. \n\nWe also apparently keep to the principle of visual balance. We have three distinguishable, coherent pieces of work, and to each their own line. So no problems there.\n\nAnd mosaic-wise, I think the function looks quite nice. All in all, valued citizen. \n\n#### Miscellaneous\n\nI want also to take this chance to make a point that, beyond general principles, sometimes there are miscellaneous, 'one-time' visual factors that come into play, and which I thought were evident in the present case. I thought that it was funny because the square brackets of an array actually look a bit like they are enclosing a real digital clock. E.g.\n\n```javascript\nconst clock = time.map(getClockDigits); // is [HH, MM]\n```\n\nSo it's worth considering that there might occassionally be something unique about the context of a function which makes one implementation visually preferrable to another.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTrying to bring this thing to a close now, let us have a brief concluding chat. Because I figure that some of the audience are sitting very sceptical. \n\nNow, recall that I said that these principles are necessary to understand, *not* necessary to follow. For example, since I named for myself the principle of line waves, I have been able to recognise how much refactoring work I was implicitly dedicating to it, and I have been able with this greater knowledge to consider, from a more rationally-available perspective, whether or not such refactoring work is worthwhile -- and sometimes it's really not. What I'm trying to say is that if you refuse to know the principles, then it's only likely that you'll blindly be affected by them -- well, that is, presuming generously that you would have any taste about the matter in the first place. \n\nBut, that said, I'm not just putting out a warning. *Hear these principles, that you may do better to ignore them.* No. I don't consider visual principles beneath oneself. You should use them as a tool. Use them to improve your experience and your understanding as a developer. If heeding the visual aspects of your code does not significantly negatively impact some key alternative metric of your application, that is otherwise necessary to consider, such as performance, then why not?\n\nIf you’re annoyed about the prospect of having ever to think about them, if you're very concerned about wasting time and energy on the topic -- which is valid, you know, I get very concerned about that -- one suggestion is to think about the principles a lot for a concentrated period, similar to what we’re doing now, with many and different examples, and to use that period to drill those principles into your subconscious. Then for your future projects, you won't really have to think about the principles and your internal ChatGPT will integrate it all in for you.  \n\nAlso, to put some more background on the matter, it is my sense that readability, which these principles (notably the principle of line waves and of visual balance) affect, is a really big limiting factor for making stand-out, especially good web applications nowadays. I prophesy that the one who seriously innovates with his code on this frontier will change the game and will secure its riches. And let me emphasise a connotation here which readability has come to encompass: it's also about read-willingness. It's a vision of a codebase that you love, that makes sense, that feels good, that feels natural, that you want to work with; it’s a vision of happy developers. \n\nAnyway, I hope that you’ve found all this business useful. And that's my piece.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJustice\n","timestamp":1698359860534,"lastEdited":1698787164649},{"title":"On Attack of the Clones","path":"attack-of-the-clones","tags":["culture"],"content":"I recently watched Star Wars: Attack of the Clones. Everybody shits on this movie because of (supposedly) Hayden Christensen's bad acting and the bad dialogue. I hadn't seen it at least for a few years so I wasn't sure what I'd think but I was initially sceptical of people's concerns. And it turns out I was right to be. (More on this example in a moment.)\n\nIt's typical that people get triggered by things like bad acting, cringe moments, or poor cgi in a film or show. And there're similar prejudices for books. But a lot of the time none of it really matters -- you can trade many details like that off. What should be important for most people, most of the time, when they're watching or reading fiction, is how compelling the overrarching story is and how compelling the characters are. That's the stuff that really has the chance to impact you and change your life. A lot of the time, poor cgi shouldn't really affect e.g. whether the thing is worth watching, whether it's worth a recommendation, what rating you would give it out of 10, and so on. Honestly, I'm not even sure how often people are really triggered by it. Probably some triggering is performative and some internalised. Some people are just trying to prove how smart, tasteful or knowledgeable they are, since they see through something others might be tempted to enjoy. These are the people so sensitive they could barely even suffer the thing -- wincing all the way through, didn't you know? On the other hand some folks are afraid that they'll be made to look a fool, by the reckoning of public opinion, for confessing their admiration for something non-foolish people know is plagued with errors and inadequacies. Well I say: all of that is nonsense! some gross socialisation process which generally stifles people's curiosity and life-force. \n\nConversely by the way, it's typical that people dote on things which are very polished, but deep down lack inspiration. This is the case for instance I think with Better Call Saul, especially towards the end. BCS was always very clever, very tricky, and some people SAY that they think it's the best TV series of all time. But it made me feel a bit empty because I didn't really see what I was supposed to learn from it. (There're things you can mention but none apparently super interesting.) I felt that there was a lack of motive force driving the story forward -- like there were no convection concurrents beneath a pretty surface. That's a risk for a lot of spin-off shows and also for series that continue plodding on just because of e.g. money or tying up loose ends. \n\nBack to the Attack of the Clones example, first of all, I liked it. Why? Because it was cool. Because Anakin's character is great, and because of the political intrigue. Second of all, I didn't even think Hayden Christensen's acting was very bad. And more importantly, if his acting was a lot better, it wouldn't have significantly altered my opinion of the movie. Third of all, yes, the dialogue was a bit clunky -- but again I didn't care. I thought in fact that the clunkiness was charming, funny, and interesting. Attack of the Clones is a good example here because it has just become one of those movies that some people have decided you're not allowed to like. \n\nAn example of a movie you *are* allowed to like (as far as I can tell) is one of the Harry Potter movies. One thing which in another context might trigger people about those movies is the poor cgi of the quidditch games. But again, if you're focused on that, if that makes you indignant -- you're not thinking straight. The right approach to a slimy pixelated Harry-on-a-broom is a hearty laugh. What's generally actually important about the quidditch games is stuff like the absolutely epic symbolism which Jordan Peterson explains [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs&t=30m&ab_channel=JordanBPeterson).[^1] (JP is a genius for explaining that by the way and JK Rowling a visionary for coming up with it.)\n\n[^1]: Taken from one of his lectures.

But because the movie medium is so rich, it is always an incredibly redundant referent. My claim is that people (act like they) don’t realise *how* redundant it is. It's true that sometimes precision will be needed in factors like acting, visuals, dialogue, etc., in order to make the reference successful, e.g. there’s a subtle emotion that the actor needs to convey in his expression. And it's useful that we have access to those factors by courtesy of the medium. But a lot of the time the factors can vary quite significantly without compromising the reference at all.\n\nAnyway that's my piece.

The norm enforcer interferes with what is justly a weird person’s business in order to return them to a norm. He does this because the weird person is seen as a threat to his worldview.\n\n### Background\n\nThe worldview of a norm enforcer was inherited, passed down from a segment of his culture. He has stuck faithful to that worldview throughout his life. He has stuck so faithful in fact, that over time he has had to ward off many inner conflicts about it. Those conflicts were *buried* in hard-to-notice places of his mind. \n\nWhile the n-forcer's worldview stays flourishing, the conflicts can stay buried. In particular, the n-forcer's worldview can act a shield, sparing him from negative emotion. Therefore, the n-forcer is motivated to keep his worldview flourishing. Therefore, he undertakes forms of motivated maintainence on it.\n\nCritically, the n-forcer undertakes to make it seem like his worldview *is the only possible worldview*. The actions taken in his life, the decisions made: they were the only actions that *could’ve* been taken, the only decisions that *could’ve* been made. And that means that any life set out by a different code -- that is, as threatened by the weird -- cannot be possible. It must inevitably fail. So the norm enforcer becomes himself the regulating entity. He must make the weird life fail. \n\n### The Paradox\n\nSo that's why the norm enforcer seeks to eliminate weird people. Yet at the same time as he seeks to eliminate them, he simultaneously *needs* them. He *needs* the idea of a deviant. Why?\n\n- He needs it because, for one, suppressing the deviant is a promise of a moral quest. That gives the n-forcer something to do, with motivational power, and into which he can channel his anger. And that anger can be encompassing, and exclusionary. And so it can shroud out his conflicts about his worldview -- it can relieve deep feelings of dissatisfaction, guilt, uncertainty, boredom, and so on.\n\n- For two, the deviant is a source of gossip. The deviant is an excuse to discuss with other n-forcers the n-forcing way. And gossip is useful because it provides an opportunity for validation. After all, consider that the n-forcer does not really trust his own mind. Secretly, he is aware of his array of self-deceptions. So to the extent that he judges the Other more immune to those deceptions, he feels that his worldview is more secured by their alternative process of reason. Or to the extent that he finds another victim of those deceptions, that’s fine too because it means at least that there’s shared guilt, and thus mitigating the n-forcer’s feeling of personal blameworthiness.\n\n- For three, much as it may be attempted to be denied, weird people are interesting to the n-forcer. Anomalies are interesting. The n-forcer will be drawn in to discover the explanation for the anomaly (even if approaching in the protective guard of ideology). Relatedly, there is also the suggestion that the deviant may have enough strange knowledge to redeem; that the deviant will be able to cure the n-forcer; that the deviant will fight back, and will be able to reconcile the n-forcer’s psychology and to make him see God again. Also, there is the suggestion that the deviant is the only one with the capacity to offer the n-forcer true forgiveness.

I remember thinking that I could do impossible things just by intending to do them -- just because I wanted them really hard -- and, y'know, that everything else would happen automatically. Hehehe. At that time, coming into my own consciousness was surprising and magical to me and I made sense of it as a source of unique power. \n\nAs an older child, I thought that my specialness was about my popularity. I remember at primary school how important I thought it was that my classmates elect me to the school council. That meant that they thought me especially likeable, which is basically how those things were decided back in the old days. I probably still held on to some of the supernatural stuff a bit, but now I also had this new source of specialness to enjoy. \n\nAnother related thing I thought about as an older child was how cool I was. Towards the end of primary school I started looking into having cool hair and cool clothes and cool shoes. I was calculating my actions based on their coolness. So maybe I thought that I was special because I had a unique taste and ability to be cool. Which made me popular and sort of main-character-y.\n\nMoving into my early teen years, things became more about how handsome I was. People started commenting about it and, all of a sudden, it became super prominent in my psychology. I started to notice my face more in the mirror as it became an affordance and something about which normative judgements were made -- as it became a new source of specialness. \n\nThen into my later teen years I got unhandsomed a bit and, as well as due to other factors, now my specialness transitioned more into cleverness and knowledge. I started watching people saying fancy stuff on YouTube and I started reading fancy books. Now, part of me had genuinely *just found out* that there was a rigid order to the world and that I could use it to feed my curiosity and learn new things. And that was intrinsically exciting. But my cleverness also became an identity, tied up in a social idea that I had to *appear* clever. Which somewhat corrupted the matter. \n\nOver time, into early adulthood, my pursuit of being more cleverer and more knowledgable became more pure, especially as I isolated myself and learned to introspect. (Wow that's *so* interesting if you think about it!!!)\n\nBUT it's only until VERY RECENTLY (still early adulthood) that I realised that, God damn it, I'm still trying to protect this idea about myself, this specialness. This: I'm smart. I'm so smart and so quick. I learn fast. I'm so creative. I see through this and that. It's like bloody hell! And that's what it is by the way, it's a trait that I feel that I need to *protect*, to defend, to hold close. It totally warps my psychology. It causes me to act up. I fail to evaluate things against the standard of, like, what God would want for me, or what is the truest, realest thing that I can do. \n\nUhhhh. It's all been such a heavy weight upon me. All these years. But it's also very scary to go without. It's exposing. I feel strange without my specialness. I have returned to simply being surprised by my own consciousness. It's like all that time of ego and comparison and grandeur -- I was just running on the spot. And as I come to a stand still and everything goes quiet, I look around and I realise I'm still here. I'm still just here.

As a child, Clarice Starling wakes up in the dark to the screaming of the lambs. They're being brought to slaughter, where she's staying at her mother's cousin's sheep and horse ranch. Clarice Starling wakes up in the dark, alone. She gets dressed and she goes outside to the horses pen. There’s a blind horse in there with whom she’s bonded. She settles the horse, and with hackamore rope, leads it away — away from the screaming, and away from the ranch. The two of them run away together. The horse — prepared for meat, among others like it lame and sick — is thus saved by Clarice from the fate of the lambs. Both of them never to return. But for Clarice, also, never truly to wake up again.\n\nThe first time I read Thomas Harris' passage in _The Silence of the Lambs_, in which Clarice describes this her childhood memory to Hannibal Lecter, shivers ran up my spine, and I was instantly awash with a deep feeling of peace and of wide-open alertness. Hannibal himself is described subsequently to seem “oddly at peace”. He is also grateful. “Thank you, Clarice” indeed. I recall this feeling from similar circumstances where a friend has confided in me a precious memory. And it is, of course, the feeling of _revelation_. Below, I’ll outline shortly what I saw revealed in Clarice's memory, and how it contributes towards her overall psychology.[^1]\n\n[^1]: Note that there may be, elsewhere in _The Silence of the Lambs_ or in _Hannibal_ (the third book of Harris' series in which Clarice also appears), evidence against the following interpretation of, at least, a key _driving force_ behind Clarice Starling's psychology — I cannot be certain that the author Harris perfectly understands his own work and symbols (although I suspect he does quite well). Nevertheless, regardless of its accuracy to every detail, I contend that this interpretation is interesting and you can, if necessary, imagine a slightly different version of the character for which the interpretation justly, completely, applies.\n\n### Who is Clarice?\n\nFollowing the death of her father, Clarice’s life was destabilised. She lost a consistent support structure; she lost a foundation of mentorship and philosophy; and she was rendered profoundly alone. Therefore, Clarice bore open wounds which made her especially vulnerable to the horrors of the world. She was without framework to control what she should see, and how she should process it. So she saw too much, and processed too little. And thus Clarice was not ready for the scene of the lambs.\n\nClarice’s lambs were pure victims of suffering, escalated to a symbol; and the source of their suffering: she could not understand. In her memory, Clarice describes bare-bulb lights in the barn and in the shed by the sheep pen, casting “big shadows”; she describes a refrigerator truck in the background “idling, roaring.” She perceives in sum some indifferent, distant, alien force — some inscrutable ‘otherness’ responsible for the slaughter: an otherness which is, moreover, malevolent. She finds only a way to fight it and to run from it — her predator — but she knows not how to incorporate it.\n\nAnd thus, this unincorporated, unresolved symbol of the lambs comes in all of Clarice’s later life to play upon her subconscious, driving her — driving her to capture and control that source of suffering: to fight back against and to overcome that ‘otherness’.\n\nYet in her individual quests — for example, in saving Catherine Martin from Buffalo Bill — Clarice can never completely be satisfied. Because she can never completely be satisfied with the substitute of the particular for the universal, the concrete for the symbolic, of control for understanding. Indeed this establishes Clarice’s unquenchable thirst: the explanation for her special talents as an FBI agent. In a way, Clarice’s heroism is incidental — Clarice is pursuing relief, in particular the temporary “silence of the lambs”, which is the novel’s namesake.\n\nBut while she could only save a horse[^2], and while Clarice continues in her fundamental lack of _understanding_ of suffering and the sources of suffering, she shall remain unreconciled with the world. Clarice shall remain in a child’s nightmare — her confusion and alienation yet destined to stir again — waiting in futility for her father to wake her, to comfort her, to tell her that everything’s ok.\n\n[^2]: Dear movie adaptation by the way, it’s important that Clarice not save a lamb from the ranch. This transgresses upon the supposed-to-be inherent distance of the symbol.\n","timestamp":1701210328103},{"title":"Acting Channel Idea","path":"acting-channel-idea","tags":["culture","business"],"content":"I had an idea.

Moreover there is in these videos developed lots of theory and terminology which subsequently can be referenced in\n- The livestreams (there are livestreams). The livestreams for the channel involve having a short script or scene, which members of the public can join the stream -- can come on 'stage' -- to perform, and where each such performance is fed back on by the host (some feedback possibly crowdsourced from the chat) to help the people improve. Also there is encouraged that people keep returning to the stream -- the stage -- at later dates to shoot their shot again.\n\nThe idea for the livestreams I got from exploring the manosphere/pick-up-artistry stuff a while ago. There are streams where guys go on speed dates with girls online -- e.g. [here](https://www.youtube.com/live/w97XeCBLYPU?si=-Sc710cydGJ8xSof) is a most recent one (at the time of publishing) -- and a host gives them feedback on their 'game'. I recall that these seemed to be plausibly pretty useful for struggling guys trying to build up their social skills. They were also lively and funny.\n\nHere are some further suggestions for the streams:\n\n- There should be “life” on either side of the body of the stream where discursive discussions are had. This should help create a sense of community.\n- The streams should happen basically everyday, or maybe every other day, for the right culture of of scrappy, far-going, continual, positive-feedback-loop progress to emerge.\n- There should be a charasmatic host who makes people feel safe and can do pep talks to encourage them onto and back onto the stage. He should also be prepared to fill in spare lines and for the sake of this should be a half-competent actor himself. Also, generally, he should be a good [leader](/blog/leadership).\n- There should be recurring scripts across streams to help people try acting out the same thing multiple times.\n- It’s probably best to focus more on monologuing scenes, where feedback can be focused on a single person, but it might also be fun to occasionally have scenes involving a couple of people.\n\nHow could someone make money from this by the way? My impression is that YouTube Adsense doesn’t amount to much (plus you might rightly resent YouTube advertising). So e.g. you could do your own sponsorships, for acting-related products/services. More reliably, you could promote private coaching sessions. For low marginal cost of replication: you could sell courses, write an e-book. You could also do live shows/in-person workshops (possibly posting back recordings onto the channel). You could also have a Patreon with exclusive content like members-only livestreams or Q&As. Many options.\n","timestamp":1701531860920},{"title":"The Ocean","path":"the-ocean","tags":[],"content":"The ocean is **brilliant**. Voyages out into the ocean are **wonderfully romantic**. Generally:\n\n- the (deep) ocean is unwatched. there aren’t people around. there isn’t the great weight of convention as there is in the civilised world. there isn’t everybody watching, keeping account, keeping you explicable.\n- the ocean is virgin. it’s hardly been configured, organised, made up by other men. it is raw nature. and mastery of that nature is your own.\n- related, the ocean is unknown, most of it unmapped. it is ripe for discovery, for new encounters with the strange.\n\nAlso, however, the ocean is incredibly **dangerous** and **scary**.\n\nI AM on a small circular island platform. The waters all around are a dark murky brown, eerily quiet, and _feel_ deeply foreign to me. I note some friends tending to a boat on the shoreline.\n\nAfter an unaccountable lapse, I’m in—suddenly I’m swamped among those quiet waves. And my puny head, now struggling to peer out from the depths, cannot make for o’er them. So I cannot see nor reach out for that platform! This causes me to panic, and I lose all sense of direction. “Help!”—a stranded cry—“Help!”\n\nFortunately the friends I saw before come for me and, in the next moment, arrive—a lifebuoy and company. Ahh. Christopher Eccleston, leading the group, (somehow) stands up. “Good job men. Now we’re all— Wait—“. A couple at the front shoot a glance into the water, and instantly, a giant, green, eel-like creature bursts from the surface (!) and, in an arch, runs right through Christopher’s chest; its long body trails itself in a rushing blur, following through the hole hollowed out in a screaming Christopher. The group is frozen in shock.\n\n“We need to go! Go!” I call. And we go—but with aching slowness, resenting the weakness of our limbs! _Fuck. Come on._ I am trying painfully to move. _Towards the shore. Towards the shore. Only think about moving._ The creature is a slimy streaming bracelet half above the water, Christopher its now-limp adorning charm. _No! Don’t look back. Don’t focus on it. Towards the shore. Towards—_ Then the sound of crashing water, of the creature’s trailing arch, stops silent. “Oh shi—“\n\nAnd I wake. Phew. And then I write the dream down. And then a couple days later I thought to fit it in this blog.\n\nNotice there are three terrors of the ocean presented in that dream alone:\n\n- losing oneself among the waves;\n- the unknown predator; and\n- the weakness of the body off-land.\n\nLet me add some more:\n\n- the known predator\n- (un)known poisonous/venomous organisms;\n- (un)known giant creatures that will crush you indifferently for being in their way;\n- overpowering waves, or strange wave patterns, that drown you no diff; also\n- a giant ship that sucks you into its propellers.\n\nIn virtue of: I will never go into the open ocean in my bare person, for leisure. If I had a quest like the Argonauts, if it was part of a larger voyage, that’s another thing. But people really just go in to see the fishes. Christ I’ve done it myself. But nah, not happening again. Stop fucking around cunt. I also do not enjoy going in airplanes that pass over the ocean. Yikes.\n","timestamp":1702851128214},{"title":"Women in the Military","path":"women-in-the-military","tags":["politics","culture"],"content":"There should be no women in the military, particularly women soldiers. Why?\n\n1. It introduces sexual competition which creates hostility, dishonesty, ulterior motives, and doubt among our men. We need these men forging deep bonds of loyalty and trust -- we need them in harmony -- receiving thus the peak of human strength. An environment of sexual competition reliably compromises this. \n\n2. It distracts the men. If you've the least experience of the world, you know how psychologically absorbing a woman can be -- often is -- to a man. Thus are distracted our men from the mission, the accumulation of prowess, the perception of justice, and the forging of bonds as above. \n\nThere are some rare women who will want to join the military. But the military needs to be exclusive in order for it to be strong. So they must be turned away. \n\nWe can allow for sexual competition and distraction in the civilised world, as part of life, occassionally fun. But the military is somewhere else; it's meant for something specific; it's meant for men. We should stop pretending we know better, and stop assuming the losing position of neutrality. \n\nAs an aside, I think the door was opened for women for cynical reasons. Not for the military's interest, nor for the interest of women. There are powerful people who, clandestine, pull strings in our world. They are evil, clever, stupid, differentiated, vague, and real. I think they were responsible for this.

But we *experience* them. We feel them. And we know somehow that they are salient, important, deep. This is not just traumatic episodes: we experience *many things*, many kinds of things, that are somehow interesting or impactful to us, but which are also too raw and difficult for an undeveloped mind to take in stride. So then what we do is that we *lock those things away* in long-term memory -- or with less suggestion of will, they *imprint* themselves upon us -- and we give them this special status of SOMETHING INTERESTING HERE. We are struck with memories radiant. And *then* when we’re still but much older, those SOMETHING INTERESTING HERE memories -- we *recover* them, continually, they recur, particularly when we’re *dreaming*. \n\nRecovering the SOMETHING INTERESTING HERE memories allows us to explore them and to walk around in them. We do this not necessarily to resolve, or to analyse in productive terms (it has been a mistake of mine in recent years to consistently presume such a frame), but also to behold, to awe, to play, to be present with. This relationship of *presence* in mystery is one of the fiercest forces of LIFE. And qua mystery, yes, nevertheless there has to be something *to* resolve about the memory: it has not to be filed away as done, as some identifiable cog in a worldview, and so on. And so after my [blog](/blog/clarice-starling) on Clarice Starling in this capacity, I name such a thing an *unresolved symbol*.\n\nIn my case, I dream *all the time* of places in my childhood that I’ve found particularly *scary* -- especially which I imagined somehow pregnant with supernatural evil, which I imagined a liminal space, or somehow the dwelling place of a predator. These are many of my unresolved symbols. I never *mastered* or fully understood those places.  \n\nFor instance, there was a footpath I would sometimes take to school, where the trees on one side would overhang, blocking out the sky, like an embrace -- and I dream about that footpath all the time. Even to think of it now, I am raised in goosebumps. At night, I would avoid it. And I was always hesitant to pass through alone. When in company, I feel like I was still being privately watched, and whispered to -- like something was waiting to get me. \n\nAnother place is the utility room in my old childhood home, as well as the passage beside the home which bore a door, with a translucent window, to that utility room. That room ... it was some very strange place encroaching in an otherwise familiar, warm, comfortable home. It glows dark blue in my memory, the rest more so the colours of Christmas. In a fancy of horror, I envision that everyone who lived in the home would, now, recall the room completely differently. I can barely speak these words out loud. (Ever the fool, I am writing this at night.)\n\nIf one is haunted by an unresolved symbol, if one would benefit from a resolution, it might serve as much as possible to bring that symbol into waking life -- to use one's adult, sober self to wrestle with it, courageously confront it, and to tame it. In theory for example, it might benefit me to go back to that now-far-away footpath, newly strong, either to recognise in the matter an anticlimax, or in the case that what was waiting for me is still waiting -- still knowing that I, marked, should return -- so that I can directly lure the monster out, so that I can see its face, and so I can choose to *fight back*. \n\nI don't know how originally I'm putting all this by the way. Likely it at least neighbours some Jungian or Freudian idea. But I wanted to write in the spur of the moment, inspired by elaborating a connection -- the unresolved symbol -- I made between my memory of the footpath and Clarice's of the lambs.

So you're up. You're awake. And you're searching -- but for what? -- for an excuse. Because given the need you have also the idea that there is a kind of debt that you have to pay -- a debt to the Symbolic, to the Word -- before you can take some concrete course of action; you need a *reason*. But the reason you give -- your notion of the debt to remediate -- it's distorted, corrupted, by the strength of the need; and from which your excuse. \n\nWhile the need is around, the anxiety is around; while the anxiety is around, you will want to relieve it; and people take desperate measures, people slight the God of Reason in his own proper domain, in order to do so. \n\nIt's a simple pattern, you see, but it's worth saying out loud.\n\nPrompt an AI if you need examples to catch on. \n","timestamp":1704221728923}],"metadata":{"images":{}}}
