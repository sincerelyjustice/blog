{"blogs":[{"title":"References","path":"references","tags":["meta"],"timestamp":1698176900208,"content":"I'll make some references in my blogs to films, shows and books. I want people to be able to follow my references, so I'm going to try to source them, mostly, from a small body of popular material, which is noted here. Also note that I *really like* all the films, shows, and books that appear on this list (apart from maybe for Star Wars where I only really like Revenge of the Sith), and so it might be worth catching up with them if you get on with my work.   \n\n#### Films:\n\n- Star Wars Original and Prequel Trilogies\n- Harry Potter Series\n\n#### Shows: \n\n- The Walking Dead, Seasons 1-6 \n- Doctor Who (2005 version), Seasons 1-4\n- Hannibal\n\n#### Books: \n\n- Harry Potter again, although just watching the films should be enough\n- The Bible\n- The Silence of the Lambs\n"}],"metadata":{"images":{}}}
