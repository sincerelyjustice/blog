So I want to use this series to try to push out the boundary of the logos, to further articulate and control. When something doesn't feel quite right -- when perhaps you shift things about and all clicks into place -- we must consider, explicitly: _What was that?_ What difference made the difference? What was God's design?\n\nAllow me before we start to pay the toll to modesty: I am not a Jedi master. I have worked as a web developer with merely intermediate skill, and there're a lot of things I don't know. Nevertheless, it is a deep compulsion within my person that draws me to these topics, and ergo I have developed my piece, which I'm sharing with you today. \n\nToday we focus on unspoken coding principles, and specifically those principles *visual*.\n\n### The Task\n\nLet's say that we're given the following task.\n\n1. Write a Javascript function `getClockTime` which returns the hours and minutes that would appear on a digital clock, which are associated with a specific `Date` instance, formatted as a string.\n2. For several different implementations of such a function, evaluate their visual-based merits and demerits, and deduce any attendant principles.\n\nTo clarify number 1., our goal is basically to re-implement:\n\n```javascript\ndate.toLocaleTimeString('en-GB', {\n  hour: '2-digit',\n  minute: '2-digit',\n});\n```\n\nwhere e.g.:\n\n```javascript\nconst date = new Date('1995-12-25T23:15:30'); // then\ngetClockTime(date); // returns 23:15\n```\n\nHopefully you get the idea. I know it's a bit of a strange example, but it's true to a project that I was working on where I didn't know that the `toLocaleTimeString` method existed, and where I recognised that I was thinking about the things which make the subject of this blog. So we're gonna go with it.\n\n### Implementation 1\n\nFirst for `getClockTime`, I offer Implementation 1:\n\n```javascript\nconst getClockTime = (date) => {\n  let hours = date.getHours();\n  let minutes = date.getMinutes();\n  if (hours < 10) {\n    hours = `0${hours}`;\n  }\n  if (minutes < 10) {\n    minutes = `0${minutes}`;\n  }\n  return `${hours}:${minutes}`;\n};\n```\n\nNote that all of our implementations will work in essentially this same way: we get the hours and miutes from methods on the date object; consider whether we need to prepend 0s; and then join them up with a colon. The different implementations will be interesting to us principally because they look different.\n\nHow does this first implementation look? I claim: _wrong_. I note a couple of problems, and the first is that we have violated a principle, which I call _The Principle of Line Waves_.\n\n### The Principle of Line Waves\n\nNotice the positions, which I've marked, of the ends of the lines of this function:\n\n```javascript\nconst getClockTime = (date) => {\n  let hours = date.getHours(); /\n  let minutes = date.getMinutes(); /\n  if (hours < 10) { /\n    hours = `0${hours}`; /\n  } /\n  if (minutes < 10) { /\n    minutes = `0${minutes}`; /\n  } /\n  return `${hours}:${minutes}`; /\n};\n```\n\nAt a glance, you plausibly perceive as a developer that there is made out a pattern such as:\n\nThe 'Two Bumps' pattern:\n\n```javascript\nconst getClockTime = (date) => {\n  let hours = date.getHours();    \\\n  let minutes = date.getMinutes();  |\n  if (hours < 10) {               /\n    hours = `0${hours}`;       /\n  }                          |\n  if (minutes < 10) {         \\\n    minutes = `0${minutes}`;    \\\n  }                               |\n  return `${hours}:${minutes}`;  /\n};\n```\n\nOr the 'Comeback' Pattern:\n\n```javascript\nconst getClockTime = (date) => {\n  let hours = date.getHours();        /\n  let minutes = date.getMinutes();  /\n  if (hours < 10) {               /\n    hours = `0${hours}`;        /\n  }                           /\n  if (minutes < 10) {         \\\n    minutes = `0${minutes}`;    \\\n  }                               \\\n  return `${hours}:${minutes}`;     \\\n};\n```\n\nMyself, I see 'Two Bumps'.\n\nSo what's my point? I claim that both of these patterns are significant. Both of the patterns _affect_ you. (Especially if your someone for whom the function is basic enough that you have the mental space to allow the patterns to affect you; and especially if right now you're not focused on disagreeing with me.) Likely too, by the way, the affect is subconcious.\n\nWhat is the meaning of that affect? It's _something_ -- the patterns have connotations. For instance, 'Two Bumps' suggests to me that there are somehow two pushes of work in the function. There are two teams, somehow reasonably, logically grouped together, which accomplish their own piece of work. And also the continuity of the bumps suggests that the teams somehow imply one another or are complementary. This is often well-fitted to if-else statments like this example from the code for (the script for removing blogs from) this blog:\n\n```javascript\nif (!blogs.some(matchesTitle)) {                  \\\n  console.log(`\\nBlog '${title}' was not found.`); |\n  process.exit(1);                                /\n} else {                                         \\\n  writeBlogs(blogs.filter(negator(matchesTitle))); |\n  cleanupImages(title);                            /\n  console.log(`\\nBlog '${title}' removed.`);     /\n}                                              /\n;\n```\n\nThe 'Comeback' pattern on the other hand suggests to me that the function's code is somehow strong, and then settles down a bit, and then gets strong again -- like that there is something interesting/significant/involved/difficult/unique followed by less so followed by more so again. Here is an example from a separate project:\n\n```javascript\nconst setupFormSubmission = (inputNames, endpoint) => {\n  const form = getForm();\n  const handleSubmit = async (submitEvent) => {   /\n    submitEvent.preventDefault();                /\n    const formData = inputNames.reduce(         /\n      (formData, inputName) => ({              /\n        ...formData,                          /\n        [inputName]: form[inputName].value,  /\n      }),                                   /\n      {}                                   /\n    );                                     |\n    await postData(formData, endpoint);      \\\n  };                                            \\\n  form.addEventListener(\"submit\", handleSubmit);  \\\n};\n```\n\n(I have strained the applicability of the pattern slightly here for the sake of not having to make up an example.) In this case it makes sense that the-idea-that-we-are-defining-a-form-submission-handler, as well as the-attachment-of-that-handler-to-the-form would be the 'loudest' points of `setupFormSubmission`.\n\nSo what's happened here is that I have taken the patterns made out by our function's line lengths and I have inferred something about the function's operation -- that it has two pushes of work, has loud-quiet-loud logic, etc.\n\nNow I elevate this idea to a general principle. In general, the patterns formed about the ends of the lines of a function, which I call the _line waves_, (may) have connotations which impact your perception of the operation of the function. Also, that impact can be more or less accurate to the real operation of the function. When it _is_ accurate to the real operation of the function, I say that the function is _linusoidal_; and else, it's not. _The Principle of Line Waves_ is that functions should be linusoidal. By the way, you can replace function with module or class throughout.\n\nImplementation 1 is not linusoidal. I have suggested that there is a meaningful impact of its line waves. And it is an easy exercise to explain that that impact is misleading. E.g. For 'Two Bumps', I expect minimally to see correspondent two logical groupings of work. Here is one such:\n\n```javascript\nlet hours = date.getHours();    \\\nlet minutes = date.getMinutes(); |\nif (hours < 10) {              /\n  hours = `0${hours}`;      /\n}                       /\n```\n\nWhich is no such. \n\nHow do we make the function linusoidal? One simple technique is to 'break the wave' by adding newlines as below:\n\n```javascript\nconst getClockTime = (date) => {\n  let hours = date.getHours();     \\\n  let minutes = date.getMinutes();  \\\n\n  if (hours < 10) {       \\\n    hours = `0${hours}`;   \\\n  }                         \\\n  if (minutes < 10) {        \\\n    minutes = `0${minutes}`;  \\\n  }\n\n  return `${hours}:${minutes}`; \\\n};\n```\n\nNotice then how that instead of 'Two Bumps', or the 'Comeback', we have mainly just those two distinct slopes which suggest _bit of logic followed by separate bit of logic_, which at least is accurate and I think this makes the function look a lot better. Really. \n\nSo that is the principle of line waves and our simple way here of addressing it. But then of course that leaves still the matter of the second problem, evident with or without newlines -- since recall that I noted that there were a couple of problems with Implementation 1 -- and the second is that we have violated another principle, this time which I call _The Principle of Visual Balance_.\n\n### The Principle of Visual Balance\n\nNotice the chunkiness of this middle section for the if statements:\n\n```javascript\nif (hours < 10) {\n  hours = `0${hours}`;\n}\nif (minutes < 10) {\n  minutes = `0${minutes}`;\n}\n```\n\nIt takes up six lines. For this function, that is a fair deal of space. And thereby, it puts significant weight — I argue, too much weight — on the matter of prefixing the zeros.\n\nConsider `getClockTime`’s perspective. From its perspective, a lot of the 'important work' should’ve already been done once we had gotten the actual relevant number of hours and minutes, from the date object, for the time. To dedicate a bunch of its lines to this minor other thing, re prefixing the zeros -- it's a distortion. When I look at this function and I gauge its key operations, its key work, my attention is drawn to this overlarge middle portion. And that misrepresents the abstract story about `getClockTime`'s responsibilities.\n\nTo come at this with the help of an alternative context, one place for which similar considerations frequently arise is in the rendering logic in the return statement of a React component. \n\nFor the page that you're currently reading this on, which is written using React, the distinguishing logic resides in a component called `BlogPage`. When I was adding the ability for me to edit blogs, I added the ability also for the user to see a 'last edited' date. That made the return statement of `BlogPage` look like this:\n\n```javascript\nreturn blog ? (\n  <div className={styles.blogContainer}>\n    <article className={styles.blog}>\n      <h1 className={styles.blogTitle}>{blog.title}</h1>\n      <span className={styles.blogDate}>\n        <small>{getCalendarDate(blog.timestamp)}</small>\n        {blog.lastEdited && (\n          <small>\n            (<em>Last edited:</em> {getCalendarDate(blog.lastEdited)})\n          </small>\n        )}\n      </span>\n      <hr />\n      <main>\n        <Markdown>{blog.content}</Markdown>\n      </main>\n    </article>\n  </div>\n) : null;\n```\n\nWith that option of an additional 'last edited' date, suddenly a bunch of space in the return statment is afforded to the logic of date-gathering. At a glance, one can barely even notice the `h1` for the blog's title. And thus introduces a problem of a misdistribution of emphasis.\n\nI fixed this problem by introducing a separate component, `BlogDate`, to encapsulate the date-gathering logic, changing the return statment like so:\n\n```javascript\nreturn blog ? (\n  <div className={styles.blogContainer}>\n    <article className={styles.blog}>\n      <h1 className={styles.blogTitle}>{blog.title}</h1>\n      <BlogDate blog={blog} />\n      <hr />\n      <main>\n        <Markdown>{blog.content}</Markdown>\n      </main>\n    </article>\n  </div>\n) : null;\n```\n\nWhich is obviously much neater and reads much more sensibly. \n\nIn both of the examined cases then, what is the underlying, regulating principle? We should be able to generalise. \n\nWell, in general, the proportion of space that a piece of code occupies in its containing function (which combines line length, line number, and negative space) affects your perception of the code’s importance to that function -- of the importance of understanding that code in order that you might understand the function, and the function's responsibilities. I say that when this effect of *perceived* importance is accurate to the *true* importance, then the function is _visually balanced_; and else it’s not. _The Principle of Visual Balance_ is that functions should be visually balanced. (Again you can replace module or class.)\n\nReturning to our case of Implementation 1, I am claiming that we have violated this principle. To respect it, one thing that we can do, which is possible in Javascript, is to get rid of those braces for the if statements, reducing a hefty six lines into a more modest two:\n\n```javascript\nconst getClockTime = (date) => {\n  let hours = date.getHours();\n  let minutes = date.getMinutes();\n\n  if (hours < 10) hours = `0${hours}`;\n  if (minutes < 10) minutes = `0${minutes}`;\n\n  return `${hours}:${minutes}`;\n};\n```\n\nAnd since the context has changed for the line waves, I would bring this together like so to obtain:\n\n```javascript\nconst getClockTime = (date) => {\n  let hours = date.getHours();\n  let minutes = date.getMinutes();\n  if (hours < 10) hours = `0${hours}`;\n  if (minutes < 10) minutes = `0${minutes}`;\n  return `${hours}:${minutes}`;\n};\n```\n\nAnd, ah, that's better. Notice that the matter of prefixing the zeros is much more snappy -- `getClockTime` is more appropriately impatient with it. And we achieve (at least a greater) visual balance.\n\nAlso, note with this development that the ends of the lines of the function now form a new pattern, which is worth evaluating, and which also I supsect is quite common, and which I call the 'Reset' pattern:\n\n```javascript\nconst getClockTime = (date) => {\n  let hours = date.getHours();        \\\n  let minutes = date.getMinutes();       \\\n  if (hours < 10) hours = `0${hours}`;      \\\n  if (minutes < 10) minutes = `0${minutes}`;  |\n  return `${hours}:${minutes}`;              /\n};\n```\n\nThe 'Reset' pattern happens whenever you have a slope in a function's body followed by a shorter return statement. What this suggests is like that there was a chunk of work building up to the return statement, and which statement, short and blunt, was then able to draw everything together and to tie it off succintly with a bow. Moreover then this suggests to me that the function should not have any side effects, or any leakages or suchlike, because it's as if everything was cleaned up at the return. \n\nSince those suggested meanings are accurate to the context of `getClockTime`, the function remains linusoidal. And with visual balance, the two previously-noted problems are thus no more for Implemenation 1. So is that all?\n\n### Pivoting into Implementation 2\n\nInstead of simply presenting Implementation 2, I will motivate it. For the sake at least of curiosity, here are some problems that yet remain with Implementation 1, which do not have a visual basis, but which in the course of an ordinary developer's thought process may suggest that there is a better path:\n\n1. You should try to avoid reassigning variables where the reassignment so causes the meaning of the variable to become ambiguous. In our case, the hours/minutes variable holds an integer, and subsequently, confusingly, is reassigned to a string.\n2. These two lines:\n\n  ```javascript\n  if (hours < 10) hours = `0${hours}`;\n  if (minutes < 10) minutes = `0${minutes}`;\n  ```\n\n  have the same logic, and it would be nice to know -- like, OK, but to what abstraction does that logic correspond? Because that is the abstraction that `getClockTime` would preferably deal with. Contrast with the first two lines:\n\n  ```javascript\n  let hours = date.getHours();\n  let minutes = date.getMinutes();\n  ```\n\n  Here there is encapsulated some relevant logic, and `getClockTime` is just exposed this interface of `getHours` or `getMinutes`. `getClockTime` is responsible for a certain 'level of the converation', and the first two lines just set the tone. We want more appropriately to conform to it in the subsequent lines. \n3. Sometimes there is a linting rule in the codebase you're working in about if statements always having braces. In that case the implementation that we have without them would not be possible. It might seem a bit anti-climactic for me to point this out but I thought that it was worth doing so for the sake of the general point that occassionally one has to deal with annoying incidental facts like this.\n\nSo with a mind to solving all three of those problems, let us introduce Implementation 2.\n\n### Implementation 2\n\n```javascript\nconst getClockTime = (date) => {\n  const hours = date.getHours();\n  const minutes = date.getMinutes();\n  const clockHours = getClockDigits(hours);\n  const clockMinutes = getClockDigits(minutes);\n  return `${clockHours}:${clockMinutes}`;\n};\n\nconst getClockDigits = (time) => {\n  return `${erasable('0', time >= 10)}${time}`;\n};\n```\n\nWhat's changed here? Importantly, Implementation 2 makes use of a new function, `getClockDigits`, which does the work of the earlier if statements. I've also been a bit cheeky and I've introduced a third function, which I’m assuming that you have access to by another means, which `getClockDigits` uses, called `erasable`. Now the reason that I thought it was excusable for me to include this was because I thought it might be a good, instructive aside for me to outline the reason why I'd want to. \n\nNote that `erasable` works like this: \n\n```javascript\nconst erasable = (string, erasureCondition) => {\n  return erasureCondition ? '' : string;\n}\n```\n\nThe reason that I'd want to include it is because I think that it’s good to have little functions like this that give-you-a-name-for-the-thing and which declare your intentions. For `erasable` in particular, I also like the way that it puts emphasis on possible erasure of a substantial string, instead of say addition of an empty string. I also like the way that it gives you a visual metaphor. \n\nAnyway, we’re not super concerned about how `getClockDigits` works because we’re focused on `getClockTime`. We might be more concerned about it if we were considering visual principles at the module level. So let's consider `getClockTime`.\n\n#### Line waves and visual balance \n\nWe've identified a couple of principles already. So how does Implementation 2 square up?\n\nFor line waves, we have a slightly less pronounced 'Reset' pattern.\n\n```javascript\nconst getClockTime = (date) => {\n  const hours = date.getHours();           \\\n  const minutes = date.getMinutes();         \\\n  const clockHours = getClockDigits(hours);    \\\n  const clockMinutes = getClockDigits(minutes);  \\\n  return `${clockHours}:${clockMinutes}`;       /\n};\n```\n\nWhich is still adequate. And so the function is still linusoidal. \n\nFor visual balance, we have a similar core distribution of space. And so the function is still visually balanced. \n\n(Actually, I'd argue all the more so. Notice that, despite the fact that `getClockDigits` only, as a matter of fact, involves possibly prefixing zeros, the higher stature of the abstraction in `getClockTime` means that lines 3 and 4 have done more to earn their place.)\n\n### The Mosaic Principle\n\nNow we're going to use Implementation 2 to identify a third principle -- not from the principle's violation, but from the appearance of having conformed to it. Implementation 2 conforms to a third principle, which I call *The Mosaic Principle*. \n \nNote: This principle will be somewhat annoying to demonstrate. I have accepted certain formatting limitations for this blog, and there are issues with me choosing now to include images, and so for the matters discussed the reader will either have to use their imagination or to paste the relevant code into some editor they have on hand.\n\nHere's the background. \n\nNotice that Implementation 2 involves a predominace of variable declarations on the left hand side. On the right hand side, a predominance of function calls. Your editor will colour each of these in a consistent fashion. In my editor, the left hand side is predominantly blue, and the right a light yellowish/beige-ish colour. It looks consistent and orderly, which feels soothing and safe. Compare that to Implementation 1. The admixture of variable declarations and function calls with in this case if conditions, numeric literals, and a sprinkling more of template strings, makes for a greater disorder of colours and makes one thereby more uneasy. \n\nIt's so that Implementation 1 lies especially in accordance with a principle which I call *The Mosaic Principle*. The idea is that the colours that your editor uses to highlight your code within a function form a more or less visually pleasing mosaic. I say that when the colours _are_ visually pleasing, then the function is *mosaical*; else, it’s not. *The Mosaic Principle* is that functions should mosaical (relative to some benchmark of syntax highlighting). \n\nNow, you will notice that I am introducing this principle with a little less motivation than the others. I will say briefly that I consider it to be the lowest priority of those mentioned. Obviously one thing to note is that, since it’s probably not a good idea to standardise syntax highlighting across say your team, there is going to be some variation in the relevant colours painting a function's code between developers, and so the principle bears only or mainly upon projects undertaken by a single individual. Another thing to note is that I’ve stated the principle in terms of what’s \"visually pleasing\", but it’s unclear to me what the role of that feeling of visual pleasure is. What information am I getting from the function's mosaic? Is that useful? Misleading? Is a good mosaic proxying for something else which should more justly be the focus? I'm not entirely sure. \n\n### Pivoting into Implementation 3\n\nRegardless, we can now name three principles: of line waves, visual balance, and the mosaic principle. Now we will move on to a third implementation of `getClockTime`, which will allow us to study the principles further, and to see what else becomes of a fresh face. What cause is there to move on this time? \n\nOne thing which you might be alert to in Implementation 2 (here it is again for a reminder)\n\n```javascript \nconst getClockTime = (date) => {\n  const hours = date.getHours();           \n  const minutes = date.getMinutes();         \n  const clockHours = getClockDigits(hours);    \n  const clockMinutes = getClockDigits(minutes);  \n  return `${clockHours}:${clockMinutes}`;       \n};\n```\n\nis this repetition of \"hours\", \"minutes\", \"clockHours\", \"clockMinutes\", and especially if we were going to add seconds to that list, you might wonder simply why we were choring ourselves with so much work. And thus here is a means to get rid of it:\n\n### Implemetation 3\n\n```javascript\nconst getClockTime = (date) => {\n  const time = [date.getHours(), date.getMinutes()];\n  const clock = time.map(getClockDigits); \n  return clock.join(':');\n};\n\nconst getClockDigits = (unit) => {\n  return `${erasable('0', unit >= 10)}${unit}`;\n};\n```\n\nSo, again, we have something which works in essentially the same way, the treatment on this occasion using an array. And what of the principles?\n\n#### Line waves and visual balance and mosaicality\n\nNotice that Implementation 3 is nicely linusoidal:\n\n```javascript\nconst getClockTime = (date) => {\n  const time = [date.getHours(), date.getMinutes()]; /\n  const clock = time.map(getClockDigits);         /\n  return clock.join(':');                     /\n};\n```\n\nIt follows a 'Convergent' or 'Funnel' pattern; which in general suggests getting closer and closer to the return statement with each line building upon the previous; it suggests progressively 'separating the wheat from the chaff'; and we don’t take any sort of tangents or detours. Since that attests truly to our implementation (we get the time, and from the time we get the clock, and from the clock we get the clockTime), we have the principle of line waves. \n\nWe also apparently keep to the principle of visual balance. We have three distinguishable, coherent pieces of work, and to each their own line. So no problems there.\n\nAnd mosaic-wise, I think the function looks quite nice. All in all, valued citizen. \n\n#### Miscellaneous\n\nI want also to take this chance to make a point that, beyond general principles, sometimes there are miscellaneous, 'one-time' visual factors that come into play, and which I thought were evident in the present case. I thought that it was funny because the square brackets of an array actually look a bit like they are enclosing a real digital clock. E.g.\n\n```javascript\nconst clock = time.map(getClockDigits); // is [HH, MM]\n```\n\nSo it's worth considering that there might occassionally be something unique about the context of a function which makes one implementation visually preferrable to another.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTrying to bring this thing to a close now, let us have a brief concluding chat. Because I figure that some of the audience are sitting very sceptical. \n\nNow, recall that I said that these principles are necessary to understand, *not* necessary to follow. For example, since I named for myself the principle of line waves, I have been able to recognise how much refactoring work I was implicitly dedicating to it, and I have been able with this greater knowledge to consider, from a more rationally-available perspective, whether or not such refactoring work is worthwhile -- and sometimes it's really not. What I'm trying to say is that if you refuse to know the principles, then it's only likely that you'll blindly be affected by them -- well, that is, presuming generously that you would have any taste about the matter in the first place. \n\nBut, that said, I'm not just putting out a warning. *Hear these principles, that you may do better to ignore them.* No. I don't consider visual principles beneath oneself. You should use them as a tool. Use them to improve your experience and your understanding as a developer. If heeding the visual aspects of your code does not significantly negatively impact some key alternative metric of your application, that is otherwise necessary to consider, such as performance, then why not?\n\nIf you’re annoyed about the prospect of having ever to think about them, if you're very concerned about wasting time and energy on the topic -- which is valid, you know, I get very concerned about that -- one suggestion is to think about the principles a lot for a concentrated period, similar to what we’re doing now, with many and different examples, and to use that period to drill those principles into your subconscious. Then for your future projects, you won't really have to think about the principles and your internal ChatGPT will integrate it all in for you.  \n\nAlso, to put some more background on the matter, it is my sense that readability, which these principles (notably the principle of line waves and of visual balance) affect, is a really big limiting factor for making stand-out, especially good web applications nowadays. I prophesy that the one who seriously innovates with his code on this frontier will change the game and will secure its riches. And let me emphasise a connotation here which readability has come to encompass: it's also about read-willingness. It's a vision of a codebase that you love, that makes sense, that feels good, that feels natural, that you want to work with; it’s a vision of happy developers. \n\nAnyway, I hope that you’ve found all this business useful. And that's my piece.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJustice\n","timestamp":1698359860534,"lastEdited":1698405495567},{"title":"Terrible Deaths","path":"terrible-deaths","tags":["psychology"],"content":"Here are some of the worst ways to die:\n\n1. Drowning/suffocating\n2. Burning alive\n3. A harsh disease especially which affects your brain, e.g. rabies\n4. Being eaten alive, e.g. by a bear\n5. An ingenious human method, e.g. scaphism, crucifixion\n\nIf you're alone, and if your death comes without any sense or purpose, these are all generally much worse. If you're alienated from God or you have no religious conception of death, these are also all generally worse. Sometimes if your death does come with sense or purpose but the thing was *your fault*, they're worse -- because you could've avoided it and now you've squandered the rest of your life. And if you feel like you still have a lot to give and a lot of potential then these are also all generally worse. Sometimes it's better if (you think) the thing was your fault, because you feel like you deserve your punishement. If you've sinned really badly and you think that this is your just desert, you may be able to submit more to the experience. That's related to the fact that some of these are especially bad if you're trying to escape, or if you're given false hope, e.g. 1. is especially bad if you're struggling and panicking. That can happen before or during the event. If before, it can worsen the effect of anticpation/dread as each of your ideas about how you're going to get out of this prove frightfully insufficient.\n\nConsider that people change their lives so that they can be more ready to face incidents like this -- and it's no  wonder. Most of all ofc, we should be preparing to stop them from happening. E.g. 3. makes me want to study biology and to become a doctor. But the threat will always be there. So in the seat of comfort and luxury, do not be so quick to pass judgement especially upon people's 'irrational' beliefs and practices, which help them to cope with this awful state of affairs. Do not think you're so smart that you can see through to the origin of a behaviour and scoff. You have not yet been tested. \n\n","timestamp":1698526680544},{"title":"Stress","path":"stress","tags":["psychology"],"content":"*Disclaimer: I am not an expert on the subject matter discussed in this blog. If you are affected by stress, or by any of the issues discussed in the blog, and if you are seeking guidance, seek the guidance of a professional. The opinions expressed in this blog are based on the personal experience of the author and his casual observations, and should not be considered a substitute for the professional opinion of a psychologist, physiologist, clinician, etc., in whose domain the subject matter pertains.*\n\nwhat is stress? to me stress is like this. so there’s a bit of your conscious mind which I call *your focus*. this is the part of you that engages with things. that gives thoughts explicit reality, that can bring together and compare ideas, and that uses this process to control your voluntary behaviour. \n\nok, and then here’s something *you’re ignoring*. and: it’s vying for focus. and it says: what the fuck? you need to consider me — you need to *think* about me, account for me. and you think you can just ignore me? well, watch this. it says: \n\n“Hey, body”\n\n“Uh?”\n\n“One shot of stress please”\n\n“Uh-uh” \n\nAnd your dosed with stress, and that puts pressure on your focus. And that thing you’re ignoring: It’s saying: look, I have some power here, I can cause you stress, so come on, give me what I want, bring me in to your focus.\n\nFor example, let’s say that you’re playing a video game, and therein lies your focus. But you’re also a student, and you have an essay due tomorrow; and that’s what your ignoring. *Stress*. Another example, let’s say that I slept through my alarm because I was up late last night finishing that essay, and my focus is weak and maybe I want to lay in a bed a little longer. But I’ve also got to rush to get ready so I’m not late so I can hand the essay in by the morning deadline. *Stress again.*\n\nAnd that’s stress. But what do you *do* about it? Well, that’s up to you. Remember, the thing that you’re ignoring wants to be brought into focus, so you have options. \n\n(1) You can bring it in, you can think about it, act on the thing you’re ignoring. \n\nOr, (2) you can not do so. You keep it excluded. You keep ignoring. \n\nSo we have two categories of response, two approaches. We have the\n\n- In strategies. and the\n- Out strategies.\n\nNow, here’s what I think. Strategies can become habitual and it is not uncommon that one be able to be characterised by the tendency according to which one responds to stress. I’m gonna name some strategies. My point: thereby, I’m going to be naming *personalities*. You may be reminded of people you know. \n\nHOWEVER, it's worth noting that I do not consider the strategies that I will name below a complete accounting -- FAR from it, at least in principle. Also, it's possible that many strategies be present at one time in one person. Also, the descriptions I have given are approximations, they're not precise and they may be bundling together too many things at once. Also, it's possible that thinking of responding to stress in terms of these or similar strategies should come subsequent to the resolution of some physiological issue you have which will sabotage any attempt you make to approach the subject as a matter of pyschology. \n\nNow with all that said and acknowledged, let’s get into it and let's start by looking at some in strategies -- that’s ways of responding to stress where you allow the thing you’re ignoring to come into focus.\n\n### In Strategies\n\nAmong the in strategies we have a split between what I call the unsustainable ins and the sustainable ins. This has to do with whether or not your way of responding to stress causes you to stay vulnerable to it. If it’s unsustainable, you stay a stressed person. If it’s sustainable, there’s hope your stress can at least be reduced. \n\n#### Unsustainable ins\n\nThe first unsustainable in I call the **impatient in**. This sees the stress and says “Yes yes I see you. I’m up. I get it.” It’s … uh … impatient. You probably know someone who treats you this way personally. It’s like: whatever you say is obvious and not worth the person’s time and your desire to discuss the details be dammed. And you can tell that this is how they respond to their own ideas like things that they’re ignoring. The impatient in typically finds himself in a cycle of getting distracted and returning to the annoying thing like “Yep ok ok I know”. The annoying thing, the thing you’re ignoring, keeps having to reassert itself. (That cycle creates fatigue by the way.) The impatience involved is metaphorically like not being able to look somebody in the eyes. You know that if you’re too serious about the matter, uncomfortable implications will dawn upon you. So overall you acknowledge the stress and you service it minimally, but with distractions because you're probably chronically running into error because you’re not ready to deal with things full on. This is an 'unsustainable' in for that lack of willingness to get to the bottom of things.\n\nNext we have the **fearful/subservient in**. This in addresses the thing you’re ignoring like “Yes master. Sorry master. Please, tell me what to do.” And the thing you’re ignoring straightens its back and says “Right. Yes. Gimmie 10.” It’s unsustainable because things you’re ignoring learn that this is the way to get your attention. I think that you find the fearful/subservient in a lot in the context of shame cycles. i.e., the stress makes you feel bad, so you do something which gives you relief e.g. comfort eating, and then the stress makes you feel bad again for doing the thing that gave you relief — “Great, now we’re in an even deeper hole. Gimmie 20.” — then you seek relief again and so on. You also find it in a character of extreme prophylaxis, defence, and organisation, where the person always has to be ahead of a stressful situation and always has to take the steadier path. This can lead to e.g. an overworked employee who can't say no to additional assignments, perpetually trying to please superiors and to avoid confrontation. If shit hits the fan or if uncertainty gets too great, stress can be incredibly high for such a person. They also generally live in a state of tension -- a kind of low-level stress for making sure that they’re not ignoring anything, preparing themselves against high-level stress. \n\nThe **addicted in** on the other hand says to his stress: “Yeah! Nice, nice. Tell me more.” This is someone who uses stress to drive them forward. I’m thinking of finance bros, highly competitive lawyers, certain entrepreneurs. They want to feed and encourage the idea of things-that-they’re-ignoring so that they can dynamically juggle more stuff and so they can use the stress to fuel their creativity and action. It’s unsustainable because they want it to be! A risk in this case is one’s health and also not being able to think very slowly and reflectively. That can mean not questioning one's own premises and making moral errors which are possibly severe. \n\n#### Sustainable ins\n\nRecall that to be sustainable there’s something about your response to stress that should contribute towards the ridding of it. The response should implicitly or explicitly address the stress itself, letting your subconscious ideas know that they don’t need to use the body as an intermediary and that they can make their pleas directly to the conscious mind. So what have we got?\n\nThe **fascinated in** says to his stress: “Mmm, interesting. Yes. I will think about that.” Hannibal Lecter is a very successful fascinated in. He has an incredibly deep curiosity. He is able to view his ideas and actions, as well as those of others, in this kind of pristine abstract fashion, as mathematical forms, which are all playing together and bumping up against one another and about which there is no need at all to feel stress. Stress doesn’t feature. Everything is welcome on the field based on its own merits. And actions are taken simply because of the way things must be if one is to perpetuate the freedom of one's own mind. The fascinated in is very individualistic. There is a matter of habit involved in becoming a fascinated in, but there is also a philosophy/worldview, which is possibly antisocial and which requires contradicting a lot of conditioning and prejudice. \n\nThe **consoling in** addresses the stress origin essentially as if it were the mind's offspring, like it were a child, like “Hey, you don’t need to do that you know. We’re on the same team here. We’re all trying to do our part”. The important feature is that there's emphasised an attitude of tolerance. The consoling in is not necessarily super curious about ideas, like the fascinated in -- like he will let an idea into focus and consider its object-level consequences sufficiently so that he can live a fairly undisturbed life, but what he's actually super curious about is the need from which the idea arises. He (or should I more-appropriately say she) takes a very nurturing, motherly approach. The consoling in is also my perception of how a modern-day therapist would think about how to deal with stress. Why *I’m* not a consoling in is because I find that these people are not sufficiently exacting about passing moral judgment on cetain ideas/behaviours. Nevertheless I can imagine that this strategy is appropriate for a lot of use cases, especially when a person has root insecurities. \n\nIf the consoling in is a feminine kind of stress response, then the **unified in** is a masculine counterpart. The ideal of the king to me is a unified in. When a unified in feels stress, which is rare, he considers the source of stress in the context of his moral code. He says \"come foward, and state your case\". And he considers how he can act rationally on the basis of the case so stated. The unified in is at ease with himself. He has his missions, causes, purposes, and his ideas come together to service them. He is consistent with his own morals. There isn't a bunch of a tear within hiself between competing priorities or values. The unified in response can be thought of as downstream of developing an integrated psychology and philosophy in general, where that integration was the big initial lever that brought stress down to a minimal state. Although, it's worth noting that the unified in's psychology and philosophy is not necessarily as well-understood as e.g. a master fascinated in's, which makes the unified in slightly more vulnerable to certain extreme events or brilliant expositories of reason which shake up his worldview. \n\nLet’s check out some out strategies now.\n\n### Out Strategies\n\nOut strategies mean that you’re not allowed to let the thing you’re ignoring come into focus. Like in strategies, these can also be more or less sustainable (can lead to maintained or reduced stress), but generally ... they're all pretty unsustainable. Note though that out strategies are not necessarily bad, because a person might be legitimately not psychologically ready to face some thing they’re ignoring, and they might have to go through some preparation work beforehand; they might have to gradually stalk the thing and you can't just expect them to let it all in at once. \n\nAnyway, here are some out strategies:\n\nThe **ideology out** involves having some pretend excuse as to why the thing that you’re ignoring should stay ignored. The goal is to give some (possibly-sophisticated) lip service to the symbolic order that you hope to use to squash the thing that you're ignoring and to undermine its ability to produce stress. You don’t really want to confront the thing super seriously -- you don’t want to feel out all its implications. (Which is kind of like the impatient in although the impatient in is more obedient.) You basically have a defensive complex which is able to swat the thing that you’re ignoring whenever it arises and causes stress, as if it were a fly. Political ideologies can be good at providing such a complex. Ideologies related to a false sense of one's identity can work as well. i.e., I am such-and-such a person, so I don't need to think about X e.g. my weight, or so I don't really want Y e.g. a stable work environment, etc. In general the ideology out may be broken by being challenged in a supportive context or by an intense transformative experience. \n\nThe **obtuse out** feels stress but pretends not to recognise its original cause. This is essentially a form of denial. For example, imagine you've got someone who is stressed about financial difficulties but denies this so that they can continue excessive spending, gambling, not budgeting, etc. And what does that mean they deny it? How is that accomplished? Typically, you'll have such a person with moreover a secondary object onto which the stress origin can be projected. For example for the financial difficulties person he may lash out at people close to him. That projection by the way can be more or less willful and more or less blameworthy. Sometimes I reckon it's very purely subconcious and in a way that the person might be somewhat surprised to find that the true cause of their stress was something other. They might not *consciously* be pretending not to recognise the original cause of their stress. \n\nMoving on the **distracted out** means that you try to produce such a power of stimulation to the mind that there is not the requisite ambient quiet for the thing you’re ignoring to perk up and try to assert itself. For example, you seek out crowds/constant social occasions; you're on high-dopamine apps on your phone/devices all the time; lots of focus is spent on food, holidays, drinks, gossip; and there is possible drug abuse involved. Probably a distracted out can only sleep when they're very tired late into the night/early morning because they don't want to be alone with their own thoughts. The wave of stress waiting for a distracted out can be very daunting. Also, maybe I should've mentioned this earlier but the thing you're ignoring is not necessarily right, and for a lot of people this pent-up wave is plausibly too large and they're being too hard on themselves/setting unrealistic/mistaken standards. But of course you won't find that out until you're raised within an in strategy. So seek someone out like a good therapist who can raise you within an in strategy. \n\nThere's also finally the **black out**. This is arguably the most severe form of avoidance. It's where you do what you can to shut off the mind and disable its functioning, while still basically doing enough to stay alive with some dignity and entertainment. The idea is that there should no capacity according to which the thing you're ignoring can take shape. That incapacitation can be the result of drug and alcohol abuse. Or also it can be just avoiding anything or anyone that threatens to remind you of an issue. One variant is to shun such things/people and convince yourself that there's something wrong with them. Note that you might take the black out strategy if you're unimpressed by the trappings of being a distract out. I think there is a distrubtion where the distract out is more common among women and the black out more common among men.\n\n### Concluding Remarks\n\nI hardly want to end on that note so for anyone in a bad place please remember this from Rick's speech in the Walking Dead episode \"Too Far Gone\" (which I, if not the Govenor, bought into):\n\n> But we can still come back. We're not too far gone. We get to come back. I know, we all can change. \n\nSincerely, \n\nJustice\n\n","timestamp":1698609267141,"lastEdited":1698611463956},{"title":"Favourite Music","path":"favourite-music","tags":["culture"],"content":"All of my favourite music has a story associated with it. Not from my life, but a story from stuff I've watched: a film, programme, TikTok, YouTube video, etc. I have some music that I associate with books I've read as well. E.g. while I was reading the 'A Song of Ice and Fire' books, I played some ambient music which now holds an emotional template for me that I can load in whenever I listen to it. Also, it's happenstance that the stories aren't from my life, not a principled distinction. It's typical to develop favourite songs based on experiences you've had, which are part of a story too.\n\nMusic and stories are VERY complementary media. Great stories are supplemented with music; and great music is supplemented with a story. Well actually I might be expressing a predujice there. But at least for me, considering the latter, I want to be able to identify music in some kind of embodied form. I want to be able to relate it to a character. It's difficult for me to relate to or understand it otherwise. I mean for instance, a lot of music lyrics don't make sense. You can't piece them together logically.\n\nBelow I'll list some of my favourite songs at the moment. I've chosen songs moreover that have been my favourite songs for a long time, after many listens, which is a good test that they're really meaningful. It's kind of like someone who you'd have a fling with vs someone you'd have a relationship with long-term. \n\nPlease don't listen to any of these unless in the course of watching the thing that I say they're from. Here they are:\n\n- *Civillian* by Wye Oak. This is from the Walking Dead Season 2. If you look up the song you'll find the scene in which it's played. I can't express what it's about exactly but it has something to do with the character of Shane, his isolation and his ... circumstance. I literally don't know how to put it into words; and it would be misleading/offensive for me to try too early.    \n- *O Children* by Nick Cave And The Bad Seeds. This is from Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1. It's from when Harry and Hermione dance in the tent. To me it's about Harry reminding Hermione that he feels things too, that he's there, that he sees her, that they can choose to be graceful and joyous in the face of challenge and uncertainty, and probably a bunch of other stuff besides. \n- *A Song of Captivity and Freedom* by Murray Gold. This is from Doctor Who Seaon 4's \"Planet of the Ood\". And I'm simply not worthy of addressing it. It's too powerful. It's about the way the Ood feel as slaves and once freed. I advise that you see and you hear it for yourself.   \n\nIt's a shame that music videos are so bad in general. That is an attempt to put a story to one's song or more generally to concretise the vibe. One thing which you could do as a musician wanting to market your work is to (hire someone to) make edits for TikToks/YouTube shorts/whatever happens on Instagram/etc. that go well with it. There is actually a business model there for whoever wants it. (Team of editors. Deal gets made with music producers. Etc.) If you're cutting up a version of a story that people already know, or if you have a short that people can easily understand, attaching your song to it can go a long way. One of my most recent favourite songs is from an edit about Anakin Skywalker. ","timestamp":1698535432115,"lastEdited":1698611529204}],"metadata":{"images":{}}}
